Rules of Fizz Buzz:
Replacement rules are set
The classic example is replace numbers divisible by 3 with Fizz and 5 with Buzz and those that are divisible by both by Fizz Buzz. A common variation is 4 for Coconut and 7 for Banana.
Then go around the table and count starting with 1 if you miscall the number or don't properly apply the replacement rules take a drink. It is usual to stop at 100 then add a rule and start the count over.

Create a program that implements Fizz Buzz

Novice:
Count to from 1 to 100 implementing a fixed set of 2 replacement rules.

Intermediate:
Ask for replacement rules first, then count and ask for new rules. 

Pro:
It should ask for rules.
It should ask for the number of players.
It should ask for it's place in turn order.
Then it should display the correct list of turns starting with the first player, differentiating it's turn in some way.
Then it should prompt for a rule or quit.
